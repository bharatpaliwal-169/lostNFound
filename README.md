# PET ReUNITE HUB

Basically a portal where a user can post about lost pets.
And a general community is build so that the pet can found and taken care of.


The developed project was a part of a small deal made with a client.


The idea can be to build even more full-fledge online support system for proper pet care and mantainance , can build functionality to monitor and publicise the posts on other social media for better reach. 

Contact supports, ease of use and proper design.


This is a working model, Please don't mind UI as this is build within 15hrs.
